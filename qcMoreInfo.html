			<p>This was a project I did for my DPCS class! This assignment attempted to solve the issue of
				there being multiple different apps that people use on their daily commute to contact each other, contact the MBTA, and plan how long they have until their train arrives.
				The hope was that this app would be a place where people could see any new alerts the MBTA had to post as well as any alerts posted by other users. They would also have access to their Train’s arrival time, which would use active user data to calculate, as well as each Train’s GPS service.

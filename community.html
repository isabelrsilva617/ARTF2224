			<p>This is a project I am currently working on. I am designing a responsive website, in both desktop and mobile formats. For homeowners who want to efficiently find local businesses that come recommended by friends and family and who want to share great businesses with their friends and for business owners who want to promote their business to local clients and want to connect clients with other trusted businesses, The Community is a local home services business finder that rather than relying on the reviews of strangers, allows users to connect with business through the people they know and trust. 
				Unlike other business finders like Yelp and Angiâ€™s List, The Community is a connections based program that brings word-of-mouth to a virtual format.
